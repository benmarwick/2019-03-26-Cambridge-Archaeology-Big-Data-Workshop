Distal,retouched concentrated on the distal end of a flake,,
Lateral,retouch on the lateral margin,,
Notched,deep concave retouch forming a distinct notch ,,
Lateral and Distal,side and end retouch ,,
Double Side and End,retouch located on both lateral margins as well as the distal margin,,
Denticulated,a retouched flake with a series of (more than two) adjacent notches forming a ‘toothed’ edge,,
Notched Lateral and Distal,retouch on the side and distal margins,,
Drill Like Retouch\Edge Damage,a retouched and crushed projection resembling a drill tip,,
Platform Faceting,faceting of the platform edge to create a steep and robust platform, often to create a large flake,
Flake with Old Ventral on Dorsal, flake with remnant ventral portion on the dorsal surface indicating if was struck from a flake core,,
Truncated Flake,a flake broken in two by percussion, leaving a distinct ringcrack and cone of force.,
Flake With Gloss ,a flake with a highly reflective polish on the lateral margin most likely formed from intensive use on silica rich plants,,
Striated Haematite,haematite with multiple overlapping scratches indicative of dry grinding, most likely to extract pigment powder,
Microblade,a small (<4cm long) elongate flake with parallel or tapering margins with one or more longitudinal ridges,,
Levallois-like Flake,flake with radial dorsal flake scar pattern and faceted platform, sometimes retaining a small portion of a ventral surface from the truncated faceted core.,
Burin Spall,long narrow flake, often slightly twisted, struck from the lateral margins of a flake and often preserving a remnant ventral surface from the parent flake
Pointed Flake with Facetted Platform ,flake with converging margins with a faceted platform,,
Bipolar Flake,flake produced from a bipolar core with crushed initiations on opposed ends and a typically flat and sheared ventral surface.,,
Éclat Debordant,a flake struck from the edge of a bifacial core preserving alternating imitations on its dorsal ridge.,,
Cortical Flake,flake with cortex covering the entire dorsal surface,,
Redirecting Flake,a flake with remnant platform edges on the dorsal surface signifying a reorientation of flaking orientation and the creation of a new platform,,
Chopper,typically elongate nodule with unifacial or bifacial flaking at one end resembling a strong cutting blade. This implement can also typically be classified as a single platform or bifacial core.,,
Anvil,natural stone used showing pitting and abrasion on an otherwise unaltered surface as a result of percussive actions such as bipolar flaking, nut cracking or other task involving striking an object resting on its surface. ,
Semi Discoidal,core with two distinct hemispheres showing bifacial radial flaking around part of the core perimeter,,
Faceted Radial,core with two hemispheres with radial flaking on one or both hemispheres with a faceted platform. These cores resemble unstruck Levallois core.,,
Levallois,a core with two hierarchically organised hemispheres with an upper flake removal surface and a lower platform creation and maintenance surface. Levallois cores typically show signs of platform preparation in the form of faceting of the lower surface adjacent to large removals on the upper surface that exploit areas of high mass created by the formation of lateral and distal convexities. The convexities themselves are often removed in the act of striking a Levallois flake.,,
Truncated Faceted Flake,a flake struck from the ventral surface of a large flake. The flake is initiated from a steep faceted edge (truncation). The flakes removed from the original ventral surface are typically large relative to the ventral area. Truncated faceted flakes take advantage of natural lateral and distal convexities present in the undulating ventral surface of the large flake. Kombewa flakes and flakes with varying amounts of remnant ventral surface on the newly created dorsal surface are among the products of flaking truncated faceted cores.,,
Bipolar,removal of flakes by resting a nucleus on an anvil and mparting force through a crushing blow with a hammerstone,,
Bidirectional,flakes initiated on a single face from opposed core edges ,,
Single Platform,flakes initiated only from a single platform edge on a core,,
Mulitplatform,flakes initiated from several platforms at varying orientations on a core, excluding bifacial, bidirectional or radial orientations.
